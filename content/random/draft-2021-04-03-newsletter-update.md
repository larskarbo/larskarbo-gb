Subject: Lars news: earning 600$ on a french pronunciation website + 2 other launches.

Hi everyone! üëã

Since last time, I have continued to work on my 12 startups in 12 months project.

I have also gotten a job working on the GrowthDay app by Brendon Burchard. I will do that for some months until I have enough money to focus 100% on my own projects again.

## My launches

In January, February and March, I have made and launched three new projects:

January: Imitate. A french pronunciation website that I earned 600$ on. Read more: [LINK](https://larskarbo.no/imitate-launch/)

February: Case Shortcut. Small mac utility app. ‚ö†Ô∏è I didn't get time to launch this, I'll do it later. Read more: [LINK](https://larskarbo.no/case-shortcut-almost-launch/)

March: Napchart. This is a site I have had for five years. I did a big update and added payment functionality. I have earned 35$ so far.

## Should I fail harder?

A friend of mine, Gard, asked me what my worst failure was.

I realize I don't have any interesting failure stories. As long as I get the project over the launch finish line, something good usually comes out of it.

Maybe I should set my self up to create some spectacular failures?

Have a nice April everyone!

Best,

Lars
