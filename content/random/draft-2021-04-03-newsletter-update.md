Hi everyone! 👋



In January, February and March, I have made and launched 3 new projects:

January: Imitate. A french pronunciation website that I earned 600$ on. Read more: LINK

February: Case Shortcut. Small mac utility app. ⚠️ Didn't get time to launch this, will do it later. Read more: LINK

March: Napchart. This is a site I have had for 5 years. I did a big update and added payment functionality. I have earned 35$ so far.
