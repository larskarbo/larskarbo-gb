I recommend you read this article with this song in the background:

The time has come.

After years of creating stuff into the void. After years of building things and never launching them. After years of working on other people's dreams.

I step into the ranks of the giants, and do the **12 startups in 12 months** challenge.

## Startup is the new corporate

Modern startup culture fronts ideas like **toxic work hours**, **burning bridges** and **lock-in effects**. The burnout rate in startups and the modern tech world is devastating.

I don't want to be a part of this.

I will go my own way.

## The world is getting faster

10 years ago you would need a team of 5 and months to build something.

5 years ago you could do it alone.

Now, you can do it in an afternoon -- and you **might not even need to code**.

> If you are slow you are going to be left out.

## Improve my habits

I am a builder at heart, but like many [creatives](https://customercontactadvisor.blr.com/marketing/4-reasons-creative-people-struggle-to-finish-projects/), I have troubles **finishing** my projects. Showing off your baby is a real uncomfortable thing. Many founders get stuck in this paralysis.

By taking on this project I will constantly put myself in situations where I *need* to finish. This is the best practice I could dream of for improving this habit.

## Together we are stronger

I am doing this project together with 5 other motivated makers at [12xstartup.com](https://12xstartup.com/). We are all doing our own 12 startups, but as a group we push each other, and help each other on the way.

## 12 Startups in 12 Months

I will keep updating my progress here.

**What do I want to build?**

* SaaS products on the web
* At least one B2B product
* At least one fintech bank API product
* Require little maintenence work
* Facilitate long term passive income
* Some of them focused on my key areas: **music**, **time**, **psychology**.


### #1 [Slapper.io](https://slapper.io/) - music snippets organizing tool

My first project (november) is called Slapper, and is aimed at people working with music.

**Problem:**

* No way to annotate songs in playlists
* No way to choose a specific segment of a song and store it or share it
* Different streaming services can't be in the same list

**Solution:** Slapper is a tool to organize songs and segments of songs from *any* streaming platform. Let's you create shareable interactive documents of music.
