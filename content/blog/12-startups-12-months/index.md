I recommend you read this article with this song in the background:

The time has come.

After years of creating stuff into the void. After years of building things and never launching them. After years of working on other people's dreams.

I step into the ranks of the giants, and do the **12 startups in 12 months** challenge.

## Startup is the new corporate

Modern startup culture consoles ideas like **toxic work hours**, **burning bridges** and **lock-in effects**. The burnout rate in startups and the modern tech world is devastating.

I don't want to be a part of this.

## The world is getting faster

10 years ago you would need a team of 5 and months to build it.

5 years ago you could do it alone in weeks.

Now you might not even need to code and can do it in an afternoon.

If you are slow you are going to be left out.

## Improve my habits

I am a builder at heart, but like many [creatives](https://customercontactadvisor.blr.com/marketing/4-reasons-creative-people-struggle-to-finish-projects/), I have troubles **finishing** my projects. Showing off the baby is a real uncomfortable thing. Many founders get stuck in this paralysis.
