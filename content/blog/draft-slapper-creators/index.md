When you are a musician, or work with music, listening to music is really important.

And sometimes when you listen to music you'd like to save something you heard right.

Maybe you want to save it for later.

But the best thing we have today is a playlist.

You can't work with it.

In slapper you can add songs - like a playlist - but you can also annotate, organize and add tags to songs. Also reference a specific segment. Save the things in a collaborate.


## Why playlists suck

Playlists were never made for organizing music for inspiration.

Playlists are great when you want *consume* music, but not when you want to analytically organize and work with music.

As a music creator, you often want to save specific segments of songs.

Streaming services provides a great place for single source of truth, that's something we can leverage.

## Learning and collaborating

As a musician, listening is one of the most important things you can do.

Music teachers often use recordings to teach. Often, they want to show specific parts of different songs. They want to show off a style, or a technique used.

Streaming services have transformed the world of music, but they are not made for music teachers.
