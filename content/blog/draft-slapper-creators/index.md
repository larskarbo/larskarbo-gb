When you are a musician, or work with music, listening to music is really important.

And sometimes when you listen to music you'd like to save something you heard right.

Maybe you want to save it for later.

But the best thing we have today is a playlist.

You can't work with it.

In slapper you can add songs - like a playlist - but you can also annotate, organize and add tags to songs. Also reference a specific segment. Save the things in a collaborate.
