*Startup influencers often talk about how important it is to find your user segment.* Who are solving a problem for? [Figure out your niche](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/finding-a-market-to-build-a-saas/) and customer segment before even building anything, they say.

I did not do that, and now I am stuck with the consequences.

I made an app, released it, and now I am stuck with different users with different needs. Which customer segment should I focus on?

> "... now I am stuck with different users with different needs"

To make this story interesting and personal, I create some fictional people that represent my customer segments.

(Drawing of Peter, Elisa, Johanne and Otto)

Meet Peter, Elisa, Johanne and Otto. They all liked my app, but they all use it for different things. And it makes me crazy.

Let's break it down.

## Peter: The instrumentalist

(Drawing: Dude with a guitar, looping a segment and practicing)

**Peter uses Slapper to loop specific segments of a song when practicing.** He values speed, and doesn't care about sharing collections with his friends.

**Wants:**

* Speed control
* More precice segment chooser

## Elisa: The inspiration gatherer

(Drawing: Woman listening to music and taking notes.)

**Elisa uses Slapper for memorizing and organizing songs.** She also likes to share the collection with her friends or revisit it later. Sometimes she uses it professionally in music or art projects.

**Wants:**

* Add a cover image to a slap

## Johanne: The music teacher

(Drawing: Woman listening to music and taking notes.)

**Johanne uses Slapper for giving homework to students.** To be able to share it with students is key.

**Wants:**

* More space for writing notes and chords.
* Notes on segments also

## Otto: The playlist person

**Otto uses Slapper for having Youtube and Spotify in the same playlist.** He doesn't care much about the segments or notes. He's just too tired of having to switch between streaming services to play his favourite songs

**Wants:**

* Automatic sync from Spotify to Slapper.


## Who to choose?

**Am I left trying to make one piece of software fit for 4 different people?**

Or should I choose the most relevant usecase and double down on it?

The answer is probably the second one. Trying to be generalist doesn't work well when building a bootstrapped business. I need to find a niche and solve it well.

(maybe a table here?)
